# TicTacToe
Description:
The Tic Tac Toe Game is a classic, two-player, pencil-and-paper game brought to life on the web! This interactive game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it accessible through any modern web browser.

How to Play:
Objective: The objective of the game is to be the first player to form a line of three symbols (either "X" or "O") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the 3x3 grid.

Player Turns: The game starts with Player 1 (usually "X") making the first move. Players take turns to place their symbols on the empty cells of the grid.

Making a Move: To make a move, click on an empty cell on the grid. The current player's symbol will be placed in that cell.

Winning Condition: The game ends when one of the players successfully forms a line of three matching symbols. The game will display a congratulatory message indicating the winner. If all cells are filled and no player forms a line, the game ends in a draw.
